        <h1>Home</h1>
<p>A strange sandstone building in the middle of the <a href="./the-university">University</a> campus. I apparently only moved in recently, as it was previously a University building and students still detour through the ground floor to save themselves a longer walk around. The front and back doors are big double doors that don't shut properly, so I've been unable to prevent them from walking through my living room.</p>
<p>The layout of the house is strange, with large high ceilinged rooms and lots of unexpected doors. A lot of these doors are locked and I don't have the key to them. One of them appears to lead to the adjacent University building, with a complicated system of institutional locks and catches. The decor throughout is jarring and disjointed;  lots of vivid, clashing colours.</p>
<p>Someone tells me the house was originally built by a billionaire,  somewhat improbably active in both the 1930's and 1990's. The house itself looks Victorian though. There is a large, heavy metal safe door built into the wall of my bedroom.</p>
<p>In one of the downstairs rooms A.MAZE is running an exhibition of some kind. There are a lot of mostly naked people made up as porcelain dolls wandering through the exhibition and the ground floor as a whole.</p>
<p>It is very stressful to live in a house constantly filled with so many people passing through.</p>
