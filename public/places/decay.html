        <h1>Decay</h1>
<p>When I was young I had one particular recurring dream, involving girders, ochre fog, an isolated cottage, and ending with an image of a pure white sphere that gradually got eaten up with browndecayrust.</p>
<p><em>the texture of the sphere is somehow important; it was matt white, very slightly rough, I remember the shading being slightly blue; it resembled an imperial mint</em></p>
<p>As a teenager that image kept reappearing for me separate from my dreams. I would often see it when I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>I stopped having that dream - and seeing the imperial mintâ†’decay image when I closed my eyes - after I left for university, but it came back when I was older.</p>
<p>As an adult it appears when I am particularly stressed. Again: awake, when I close my eyes. The difference now is that it no longer starts as white; it starts decayed and gets even more decayed and rusted and crumbled and fractured.</p>
<p>This is not a place, and perhaps does not belong here.</p>
