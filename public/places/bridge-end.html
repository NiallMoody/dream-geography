        <h1>Bridge End</h1>
<p>(was that its name? I remember it began with a B)</p>
<p>A small town in England on one of the main rail lines to Scotland. I was either accompanying a pregnant woman who was having trouble arranging travel back to Scotland, or I <em>was</em> the pregnant woman who was having trouble arranging travel back to Scotland (possibly I was both?).</p>
<p>I spent the night in a very Scottish-feeling tenement with a big bay window and polished wood floors, before attempting to make my way to the station. The station was attached to a very large, very busy, confusingly laid-out shopping mall. In order to get to the station I had to find a way through the confusing mall. I was not successful.</p>
