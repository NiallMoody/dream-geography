        <h1>Elaborate brickwork</h1>
<p>In an English town on the south coast, I am on the promenade. Soldiers on horseback come rushing along it, looking for something. I don't know what it is, but soldiers are bad news. I duck inside the nearest building to hide.</p>
<p>The building is strange, all curves, elaborate red brickwork, and narrow gaps you can squeeze through to reach other parts of the building. The soldiers are inside, I can hear them stomping about. I squeeze through one of the narrow gaps and see them coming towards me. I dive through the nearest doorway and find myself in a tiny library.</p>
<p>Before I can close the door I am joined by an older woman. She seems to know something about me.</p>
<p>Flash forward. We are on a steam train heading north. We are passing through fields and there is a large tree. The woman jumps off the train, seemingly unconcerned about leaping off a moving train. I spend a long time talking myself out of it, but eventually follow her.</p>
<p>She is under the tree, which is covered with fruit (mostly blueberries and brambles). Closer up I can see that there is an elaborate, curving brick wall surrounding the tree (hidden from a distance by its branches). I understand that the woman planted the tree, and built both this wall and the earlier building. She tells me about the specific bricks she used to build the wall. The tree is very old; she must be <strong>a lot</strong> older than she looks.</p>
<p>We talk; this is an initiation. I fall asleep, and she is gone when I wake up.</p>
<p>When I have had this dream before it has carried on further, but this is the point where I returned to the waking world this time, so I don't know what happens next.</p>
