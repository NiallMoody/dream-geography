        <h1>Possilpark</h1>
<p>Possilpark is a neighbourhood in the Northwest of <a href="./glasgow">the City</a>, beyond the <a href="./byres-road">West End</a>. Built as one man's vision of utopian living, it consists of a long curve of connected buildings, bordering a vast artificial lake on the outside edge of the curve.</p>
<p>On construction (in the 1950's/60's) it was intended to strengthen relations with Turkey, with plans for the neighbourhood to source the majority of the supplies necessary for its day-to-day running from that country. That relationship seemingly fell apart before the neighbourhood was completed, but the outside areas are gravelled with tiny, smooth blue-black stones (apparently from Turkey, or perhaps intended to appeal to the then-president of Turkey).</p>
<p>Everyone living in Possilpark is provided with all their day-to-day needs by the neighbourhood. It is a very clean, very middle class place. There is a hierarchy however, with the founder at the top, and a small group below him who enjoy particular privileges. This group eats in a small dining room at the centre of the neighbourhood. Tables in this room are laid out in a line, with the founder's table in the centre. The founder seemingly passed away some time ago, but the rest of the group keep his table laid out for him anyway.</p>
<p>From outside the buildings seem strangely modern, all clean angles and smooth grey stone. Inside, however, things are a little shabby, with a lot of the signs and furniture unchanged since the 60's and showing their age. The design of the furniture in particular seems older and shabbier than the neighbourhood's 60's origins.</p>
