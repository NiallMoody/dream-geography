        <h1>Dundee</h1>
<p>Dundee is built around a large natural basin or harbour, surrounded by steep, bewilderingly tall slopes. The slopes are covered in buildings; tall sandstone tenements and warehouses. Multiple bridges span the basin, at a variety of different heights and in a variety of different styles, from Victorian iron work to sleek concrete curves. The tallest bridge is high in the sky, far above the tenements below.</p>
<p>I first entered this Dundee from the South, from a different dream. I followed a long, gently ascending road, eventually encountering the city's outskirts at the road's peak, before descending down to the harbour, into the city.</p>
