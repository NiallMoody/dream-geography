        <h1>The Hospital</h1>
<p>There is a hospital. It has seemingly endless convoluted corridors, most of which end in dead ends, or tiny hatches you might squeeze through to enter the duct work.</p>
<p>The Hospital is connected to a vast, sprawling, yet somehow claustrophobic shopping mall.</p>
<p>I have visited the Hospital many times, though never, I think, as a patient. I have never been able to find the way out.</p>
