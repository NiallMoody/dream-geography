        <h1>What is this?</h1>

        <p>
          I tend to have (somewhat intermittently) recurring dreams, and I
          realised a while ago that the landscapes and places in my dreams seem
          to be consistent across entirely separate dreams. i.e. I have visited
          places in one dream that I previously visited in a different dream.
          And in the course of a single dream I have even travelled from
          locations I visited in that dream to locations I previously visited
          in an entirely separate dream.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          On top of this, all my dreams seem to take place in Scotland, with
          cities and towns that mirror cities and towns from the waking world.
          Only, the dream versions of these places vary from being very similar
          to their waking counterparts, to <strong>very</strong> different from their
          waking counterparts.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The strange sense I get that my dreams exhibit a consistent, shared
          geography, one that mirrors the waking world according to a logic I
          don't understand, led me to start recording the places I have visited
          in my dreams.
        </p>

          This site is a record of those places I have visited in my dreams, with
          hyperlinks to document the connections between different places. The
          <a href="/todays-dream">today's dream</a> link will serve up a page
          chosen randomly based on the current date.

          I've been documenting my dreams as markdown files in
          <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, stored locally on my
          harddrive (and mirrored to my phone using
          <a href="https://syncthing.net/">SyncThing</a>). This site is
          effectively a custom static site generator written in node.js that
          generates html pages for each markdown file. The idea is that updating
          this site should be as easy as just uploading a new markdown file
          whenever I document a new place.
