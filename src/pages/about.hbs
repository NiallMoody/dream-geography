          I tend to have (somewhat intermittently) recurring dreams, and I
          realised a while ago that the landscapes and places in my dreams seem
          to be consistent across entirely separate dreams. i.e. I have visited
          places in one dream that I previously visited in a different dream.
          And I have even travelled from locations I visited in one dream to
          locations I previously visited in an entirely separate dream.

          On top of this, all my dreams seem to take place in Scotland, with
          cities and towns named after cities and towns from the waking world.
          Only the dream versions of these places vary from being very similar
          to their waking counterparts, to <em>very</em> different from their
          waking counterparts.

          geography, one that mirrors the waking world in
