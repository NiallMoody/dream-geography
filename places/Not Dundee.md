Trying to make my way home on a bright sunny day I found myself following someone who said he knew the way.

This person led me through a field planted with low-growing leafy plants, which sloped upwards toward an embankment. Scrambling up the embankment, the top of which turned out be just loose soil, we found ourselves at the top of a tall hill, looking out over the city. At this point I realised we were not in [[Dundee]].

Just below us were a series of staggered, individual 4-storey tenements, and far below, beyond the city, the sea stretched out to the horizon.

Dwarfing the city and the hill we were on there was also a vast mound some distance to our left, shaped like a cone with the top cut off. At first I thought it was just another hill, but looking closer there was a spiralling track cut into its side, and I realised it was actually an enormous spoil heap.
