A long building, converted from some kind of warehouse. On the top floor a shop, filled with all sorts of handmade bits and pieces, very little space to move. Downstairs a variety of workshops and coworking spaces. I think a cafe too?

I visited with a friend, who was showing me the coworking space she'd found. She hooked up with one of the artists, said she'd meet me at no.58. I didn't know where or what no.58 was, but they were thoroughly wrapped up in each other and I didn't want to interrupt, so I went for a wander.

Found myself on a confusing version of Maryhill Road, but didn't know where I was supposed to be going, so ended up back at the warehouse. All the lights were out and it looked like it was closing for the night, but I eventually found all the artists gathered in one room, ready to head home. At that moment a large bird of prey circled above us before alighting on the warehouse roof.
