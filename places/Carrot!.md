A house called **Carrot!** for some reason. I moved there with my family, though I had more, and different, siblings than in the waking world.

The house is on a busy A-road in the countryside. South of the house is a ridge of tall, rocky hills, with the holes of a golf course extending (almost vertically) up its slopes.

I have travelled through these hills before. There are a series of glens you can follow, starting some distance to the east of the house. I do not know where you end up if you follow the glens to their end; the hills cover a significant area.
