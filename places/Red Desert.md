Somewhere to the north of [[Glasgow|the city]], a desert of dark red sand, bordered by the abandoned shells of vast concrete industrial buildings.

Towards the centre of the desert an enormous, seemingly solid concrete block, which somehow evades sight until you're right up close.

The nicest man you'll ever meet runs an Italian restaurant here.

> *bear in mind nice == dangerous*

When visiting I was accosted by a crowd of strange zombie skulls, more like animate plastic toys than rotting corpses. If encountered they can be disabled by removing their jaws.

The desert can be reached by following the [[Rare Books|embankment]] that curves round from the south of the city.
