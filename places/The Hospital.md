There is a hospital. It has seemingly endless convoluted corridors, most of which end in dead ends, or tiny hatches you might squeeze through to enter the duct work.

The Hospital is connected to a vast, sprawling, yet somehow claustrophobic shopping mall.

I have visited the Hospital many times, though never, I think, as a patient. I have never been able to find the way out.
