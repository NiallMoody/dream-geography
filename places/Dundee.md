Dundee is built around a large natural basin or harbour, surrounded by steep, bewilderingly tall slopes. The slopes are covered in buildings; tall sandstone tenements and warehouses. Multiple bridges span the basin, at a variety of different heights and in a variety of different styles, from Victorian iron work to sleek concrete curves. The tallest bridge is high in the sky, far above the tenements below.

I first entered this Dundee from the South, from a different dream. I followed a long, gently ascending road, eventually encountering the city's outskirts at the road's peak, before descending down to the harbour, into the city.

In the waking world, [[Abertay|my workplace]] is in Dundee.

There is [[Not Dundee|another city]] that is not Dundee.
