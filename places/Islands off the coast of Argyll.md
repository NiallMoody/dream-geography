These islands are low-lying and lush, with meadows and fields surrounded by trees and thick forest. Every time I have visited I have found myself desperately rushing to get back to the ferry before it returns to the mainland. The tracks around the islands are winding and unpredictable; every time it takes far longer to traverse the islands than I imagine it would.
