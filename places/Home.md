A strange sandstone building in the middle of the [[The University|University]] campus. I apparently only moved in recently, as it was previously a University building and students still detour through the ground floor to save themselves a longer walk around. The front and back doors are big double doors that don't shut properly, so I've been unable to prevent them from walking through my living room.

The layout of the house is strange, with large high ceilinged rooms and lots of unexpected doors. A lot of these doors are locked and I don't have the key to them. One of them appears to lead to the adjacent University building, with a complicated system of institutional locks and catches. The decor throughout is jarring and disjointed;  lots of vivid, clashing colours.

Someone tells me the house was originally built by a billionaire,  somewhat improbably active in both the 1930's and 1990's. The house itself looks Victorian though. There is a large, heavy metal safe door built into the wall of my bedroom.

In one of the downstairs rooms A.MAZE is running an exhibition of some kind. There are a lot of mostly naked people made up as porcelain dolls wandering through the exhibition and the ground floor as a whole.

It is very stressful to live in a house constantly filled with so many people passing through.
